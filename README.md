# NIRRedTextureExtraction
This repository contains an R script designed to generate texture data for aerial images, specifically focusing on the Near Infrared (NIR) and Red bands. The script leverages the glcm (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) package to compute various texture metrics

## How to Use
Please, set your working directory within the code according to your machine.
Here, I am loading two files as nir (naip_2020_nir.tif) and red (naip_2020_red.tif).
Output file in this case is nir2020_tex_multi.tif and red2020_tex_multi.tif.
Please, note that user should replace these variable values as required.
